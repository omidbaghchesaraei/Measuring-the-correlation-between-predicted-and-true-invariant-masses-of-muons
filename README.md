# Measuring-the-correlation-between-predicted-and-true-invariant-masses-of-muons
I measure the correlation between the predicted M (the invariant mass of two muons) and the true value using R Programming. This provides insight into the strength of the linear association between the two variables. The correlation here of about 0.86 indicates a fairly strong relationship. This implies that my model is doing a fairly good job, even with only a single hidden node.
